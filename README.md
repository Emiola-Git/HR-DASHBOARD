âœ… Recommendations for HR Dashboard Insights

Employee Retention & Turnover

With 104 terminated employees (33.4%), turnover seems significant.
ðŸ‘‰ Conduct exit interviews/surveys to identify why employees are leaving.
ðŸ‘‰ Strengthen onboarding, training, and engagement programs to reduce attrition.
ðŸ‘‰ Compare turnover by department to spot problem areas (e.g., Production vs. Admin).

Workforce Productivity

207 active employees are carrying the workload.
ðŸ‘‰ Monitor productivity KPIs (output per employee, absenteeism, overtime trends).
ðŸ‘‰ Consider reskilling or upskilling programs to improve performance.

Gender & Diversity Balance

Females (176) outnumber males (113).
ðŸ‘‰ Ensure equal growth opportunities, leadership programs, and policies that support workâ€“life balance.
ðŸ‘‰ Track pay equity and promotion rates by gender to maintain fairness.

Marital Status & Employee Engagement

44.1% single â†’ workforce may be younger.
ðŸ‘‰ HR can design engagement activities and wellness initiatives tailored to younger staff (career growth paths, learning programs, flexible schedules).
ðŸ‘‰ For married employees, consider family-friendly policies (childcare support, parental leave).

Departmental Staffing

Production has the highest number of employees.
ðŸ‘‰ Review workload distribution to ensure Production is not overstaffed relative to output.
ðŸ‘‰ Benchmark productivity vs. industry standards â€” is staffing aligned with performance needs?

Recruitment Sources

Indeed is the top recruitment source.
ðŸ‘‰ Evaluate quality of hires from Indeed vs. other platforms (retention, performance).
ðŸ‘‰ Optimize recruitment budget by investing more in channels that yield long-term, high-performing employees.

Future Improvements

Build predictive models to forecast:

Attrition risk (who might leave soon).

Hiring needs (which departments need more staff).

Regularly update the HR dashboard so leadership can take data-driven HR decisions in real time.
