👉 Conduct exit interviews/surveys to identify why employees are leaving.
👉 Compare turnover by department to spot problem areas (e.g., Production vs. Admin).

2. Workforce Productivity 207 active employees are carrying the workload. 
👉 Monitor productivity KPIs (output per employee, absenteeism, overtime trends). 
👉 Consider reskilling or upskilling programs to improve performance.

👉 Ensure equal growth opportunities, leadership programs, and policies that support work–life balance.

5. Departmental Staffing Production has the highest number of employees. 
👉 Review workload distribution to ensure Production is not overstaffed relative to output.
